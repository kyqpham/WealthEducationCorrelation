They have similar age ranges of primary schooling and, especially in rural areas, have high concentrations of job opportunities in agriculture. Less positively, both countries have high rates of malaria, malnutrition, and poverty. Specifically in rural areas, the rate of primary education completion are relatively low. Both countries have also been deemed countries with low-quality living conditions.")

Furthermore, the Indian girl's family has more money, they're able to buy more quality housing and clothe themselves.
